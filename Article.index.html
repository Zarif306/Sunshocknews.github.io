    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="24"face="Elephant" style="color: Orange;">*Bollywood Legend Irrfan Khan dies.</font>
    <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="1000" height="500" src="irfan.jpg" alt="Irfan Khan" />
   <p><font size="5" face="" style="color: white;">Acclaimed Indian actor Irrfan Khan, whose international movie career included hits such as "Slumdog Millionaire", "Life of Pi" and "The Amazing Spider-Man", has died aged 53, his publicist said yesterday.

The Bollywood star, who was diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour in 2018, was admitted to a Mumbai hospital earlier this week with a colon infection.
<br>
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the award-winning actor, tweeting "Irrfan Khan's demise is a loss to the world of cinema and theatre."
<br>
Funeral rites for the actor were under way at a graveyard in Mumbai, with only immediate family allowed to attend in keeping with India's strict lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus.
<br>
Born in the Indian desert state of Rajasthan on January 7, 1967, Khan discovered an early passion for acting and studied at the elite National School of Drama.
<br>
<br>
But his training in Shakespeare and Chekhov did little to ease his entry into the Hindi film industry, which was then largely focused on churning out formulaic song-and-dance blockbusters.
<br>
Even as he landed a role in 1988's "Salaam Bombay" -- directed by first-timer Mira Nair -- his part was slashed to a cameo.
<br>
He sobbed for hours when he found out about the cuts, he told India's Open magazine.
<br>
"It changed something within me. I was prepared for anything after that," he said.
<br>
Television roles followed, along with a handful of bit parts in Bollywood, where producers routinely dismissed him as looking too unconventional to play the lead.
<br>
By the time British director Asif Kapadia cast him as a mercenary in "The Warrior", he was ready to quit acting, frustrated over the direction of his career.
<br>
But, in a sign of the global success that lay in wait, the 2001 film racked up awards and won Khan praise -- including in India, where a new generation of directors was eager to experiment with fresh storylines.
<br>
UNMATCHED TALENT
<br>
His drama school training came in handy when he was cast in "Maqbool" and "Haider" -- contemporary Hindi adaptations of "Macbeth" and "Hamlet".
<br>
But he also charmed audiences in lighter fare such as "Piku", featuring Bollywood superstars Amitabh Bachchan and Deepika Padukone, and "The Lunchbox", in which he played a lonely accountant in love with a housewife.
<br>
Bachchan led tributes to Khan yesterday, describing him as "an incredible talent" whose death had left "a huge vacuum" in the industry.
<br>
His "Slumdog Millionaire" co-star Anil Kapoor called Khan "an inspiration for everyone, a remarkable actor, unmatched talent & a great human being".
<br>
Actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas, one of a handful of Bollywood stars to find success in Hollywood, tweeted: "Your talent forged the way for so many in so many avenues. You inspired so many of us."
<br>
Khan consciously sidestepped traditional Bollywood tropes, focusing on the subtleties of his craft.
<br>
This allowed him to carve out a stellar career in Hollywood as well, where he collaborated with Oscar-winning directors such as Danny Boyle and Ang Lee and appeared in the HBO show "In Treatment".
<br>
Filmmaker Colin Trevorrow, who directed Khan in the 2015 blockbuster "Jurassic World", described the actor as "a thoughtful man who found beauty in the world around him, even in pain".
<br>
"In our last correspondence, he asked me to remember 'the wonderful aspects of our existence' in the darkest of days," Trevorrow tweeted.
<br>
ROLLER-COASTER RIDE
<br>
In an interview with AFP in 2015, Khan said Western audiences "appreciate the elements and layers you bring to the character".
<br>
But he added: "The informality and personal connections in Bollywood are nice. Things are too compartmentalised in Hollywood, and the system can be rigid."
<br>
The father-of-two acted in almost 100 films, winning awards and the admiration of his peers.
<br>
During the press promotions for their film "Inferno" in 2016, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks reportedly described Khan as "the coolest guy in the room".
<br>
But his life took a tragic turn in 2018 when he was diagnosed with cancer. The news devastated his fans and India's film community.
<br>
Khan took a sabbatical to seek treatment in London -- accompanied by his family -- before returning to play a middle-aged father in "Angrezi Medium", his final film and a follow-up to the 2017 hit "Hindi Medium".
<br>
He suffered a relapse in the months leading up to the film's release, however, forcing him back to Britain.
<br>
In an interview with the Mumbai Mirror newspaper in March 2020, he described life after the diagnosis as "a roller-coaster ride, a memorable one".
<br>
"Happy moments were underlined because of the inherent uncertainty. We cried a little and laughed a lot," he said.</font>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="24"face="Elephant" style="color: orange;">*Procurement Delays: Boro farmers of Sylhet in trouble</font>
<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="1000" height="500" src="boro_harvest_0_0.jpg" alt="Procurement Delays: Boro farmers of Sylhet in trouble" />
<p><font size="5" face="" style="color: white;">Delay in government procurement is forcing desperate farmers to sell their paddy at lower prices to rice mill owners and hoarders in Sylhet region.
<br>
The authorities earlier announced that procurement of boro paddy would begin from April 26. But officials are now saying that the farmers' list needed for the procurement will not be prepared until another week.
<br>
"We have not received the farmers' list from the district-level officials. We will start purchasing after getting the lists," Azizur Rahman, assistant sub inspector at Sylhet Division Food Office, told The Daily Star.
<br>
The government will buy 8 lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers across the country for Tk 26 a kg this season.
<br>
Rahman said 4,278 tonnes would be bought in Sylhet division.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, cash-strapped farmer Jisan Mia said he has in the last few days sold sacks of paddy for around half of what the government had announced.
<br>
The farmer of Hakaluki Haor in Moulvibazar's Kulaura added that there were many others like him.
<br>
Makhan Lal Das, a farmer in Sunamganj's Shalla, said it cost him around Tk 750 to 800 to produce each mound of paddy.
<br>
But rice mill owners were not offering him any more than Tk 600 a mound against the government announced rate of Tk 1,042.
<br>
"I need money right now to repay the village lenders and buy essentials for the family," he said.
<br>
Abu Sufian, a freedom fighter and acting president of Sunamganj Haor Bachao Andolan, said the food department must act quickly.
<br>
"Any more delay would mean more profit for the middlemen and loss for farmers," he said.
<br>
Abdul Hannan, general secretary of Bangladesh Krishak Samiti in Kulaura, alleged that corrupt officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) were naming hoarders in the list of farmers. He demanded that the list be made public.
<br>
Communist Party leader Chittaranjan Talukder said an overwhelming majority of the farmers cultivate the paddy by taking loans at high interest rates and they could not afford to wait.
<br>
Several Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) officials, who have been preparing the list of farmers, said they were too busy monitoring relief efforts at villages and finalising the lists would take at least a week.
<br>
"We also have a manpower shortage and our officers have other tasks. However, we will make the list within the next one week, said Hasan-ud-Daulah, upazila agriculture officer in Tahirpur, Sunamganj.
<br>
Safar Uddin, deputy director at DAE in Sunamganj, said, "We will make the list by May 5 and verify it by May 7â€¦ and purchase will start from May 11."
<br>
Debol Sarkar, upazila agriculture officer in Barlekha, Moulvibazar, also said finalising the list may take at least another week.
<br>
According to the DAE, paddy was cultivated in 4,74,195 hectares this year. Over 27,96,000 tonnes of paddy is expected to have been produced. More than 41 percent of the produce has been harvested as of last Sunday.
<br>
Each farmer will be allowed to sell a maximum of three tonnes to the government this year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="24"face="Elephant" style="color: orange;">*Managing business during and after pandemic</font>
<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img width="1000" height="500" src="cv.jpg" alt="pandemic" />
<p><font size="5" face="" style="color: white;">It was a bolt from the blue! This pandemic has truly taken everybody to a surprise. The deadly germ didn't take much time to spread all across the globe after it originated in China in December last year. Around 3 million people living in more than 200 countries have been infected so far, out of which about 200,000 innocent lives were perished.
<br>
To the disbelief of many, countries which are known for having the best of the medical facilities, are also struggling to contain the notorious microorganism popularly known as COVID-19. The danger is, even after the four months of the outbreak, nobody really knows when the mankind will be able to win over the notorious enemy.
<br>
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that this virus will be with us for a long time and therefore, we should be extremely careful and vigilant in managing this pandemic for the foreseeable future.
<br>
Given the dire situation, the immediate focus for everyone, including the businesses should be on saving lives. Business organisations should come forward to join hands with the government and other stakeholders to make sure there is enough testing facilities to isolate infected people and adequate treatment facilities for the diagnosed patients. They should also be thinking of how to collaborate with the concerned research organisations or academia to accelerate the research on inventing a vaccine, which will eradicate the virus for good from this world.
<br>
While carrying out their corporate social responsibilities, corporations are also looking for the ways and means to get the wheel of their operations up and running. In this regard, the top most priority is to ensure safety of the employees who are the most valuable resources.
<br>
<br>
Over the last fifty years, the mindset of the businesses with regards to employees has changed quite radically. Businesses in the 1970s were religiously following a doctrine of Nobel laurite economist Milton Friedman. He said: "The business's sole purpose is to generate profits for shareholders."
<br>
 <br>
<br>
However, we saw a stunning turnaround in 2019, when the CEOs of the world's largest corporations in a business roundtable declared, "We commit to investing in our employees. This starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefits. It also includes supporting them through training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing world. We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect."
<br>
Keeping this spirit in mind, amid unprecedented business disruption, a growing list of businesses have vowed to pay their employees, while their business operations are temporarily suspended. This is quite obvious that people are really worried about their future. Here comes the role of empathetic leaders to stand beside their employees.
<br>
To deal with this abnormal and unprecedented situation, corporations should first assess the situation and its impact carefully.  IMF Chief Economist Geeta Gopinath described the present crisis as worse than the great depression of 1930's and the financial crisis of 2008.
<br>
According to IMF's latest forecast, the global GDP will fall by 3 per cent in 2020. Assuming that the pandemic improves in the second half of the year, economic activities start to take momentum, the global economy will grow by 5.8 per cent in 2021. The cumulative economic loss of 2020-21 will be nearly 9 trillion dollars. However, if the pandemic continues for a longer period, the global GDP will fall by further 3 per cent from the baseline assumption.
<br>
Businesses are facing multiple challenges both from demand and supply perspectives. Consumer spending has certainly plunged significantly as they are fearful, saving for the crisis, can't go out for spending and in some cases, especially in the developing countries, a large portion of them who rely on daily wages are simply out of pocket as they are unable to render their services.
<br>
On the other hand, because of lockdown in most of the countries, both primary supply chain, which deals with raw materials or intermediate goods, and the secondary supply chain, which deals with finished products, are facing enormous disruptions. All these challenges boil down to weaker revenue and increased cost.
<br>
So, what should the businesses do to face this challenging time?
<br>
Reputed consultancy firm McKinsey & Company has come up with a concept called 5R: Resolve, Resilience, Return, Reimagination and Reform to face the ongoing crisis.
<br>
Resolve: This refers to containment of the virus and its spread to safeguard lives and livelihoods. Business must ensure safety of their employees by taking measures like work from home. For business continuity, if someone needs to work outside, they will maintain proper safety guideline. In some cases, they should adopt online transaction, delivery at customers' doorstep etc. But first, stop the virus to spread.
<br>
Resilience: This health crisis is obviously leading towards a severe financial crisis. Organisations will suffer from cash crunch, shortages of working capital and ability to pay debt. To deal with these challenges business need to work with government and other stakeholders to ensure concessional financing, debt relief and even for grants.
<br>
Return:  As the situation gets better businesses should plan for resumption of their operations in phase manners. Trying to do everything together after a longer shutdown can create chaos.
<br>
Reimagination: The world will definitely be different post-pandemic. Expectations of the customers, employees and other stakeholders will be different. Organisations should carefully evaluate these shifts of the mindset and take appropriate actions. This will include use of technology, setting up plants and distribution centers closer to the customers etc.
<br>
Reform:  It is not unlikely that in some cases organisations have to reform their policies, processes to survive. This can even be changing their existing business models.
<br>
Businesses would require lots of efforts and imagination to survive. Charles Darwin, the famous scientist of all times, said it loudly, "It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive; It is the one that is most adaptable to change."
